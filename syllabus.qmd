# Course Information


We will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 16:00 to 16:50 in the [Anthropology Building, 303](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bgxTfADzf1Vz2z1EA). It is important that you read the materials before class. All information about the course is available on the course's GitHub repository at <https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151>. While I will try to adhere to the course schedule as much as possible, I also want to adapt to your learning pace and style. The syllabus and course plan may change in the semester. Again, please check [the course repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151) regularly to check for updates. I will also announce any changes in class and via email.

# Software

We will mainly use [Python](https://www.python.org) in this course. Python is a free, versatile, and powerful programming language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. I recommend using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as it comes with many necessary Python libraries for data analysis, such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). 

You can write your Python code in any text editor, but I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is also well-regarded by developers. If you are feeling adventurous, you can also use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with the [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright) plugin. That is, if [you can exit the editor](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/). :)

We will use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database management. You can download PostgreSQL from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/). Please also install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) and the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ckolkman.vscode-postgres) for PostgreSQL to interact with the database.

We will also use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in class. Jupyter itself comes pre-installed with Anaconda, but please install the [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter&ssr=false) as well. We will have a hands-on session to learn how to use Jupyter effectively.

To help you get started, I have prepared [a series of tutorials](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/tree/main/tutorials) on how to install Anaconda, Jupyter, PostgreSQL, VS Code, and open a free educational account on GitHub. Please follow these tutorials as soon as possible to ensure that you have all the necessary tools for the course.

# Office Hours

I am very flexible with office hours, but it is easier to contact me via email. Feel free to send me a message any time at [danilo.freire@emory.edu](mailto:danilo.freire@emory.edu), and I will likely reply within a few hours. You can also book an appointment with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/danilofreire/office-hours), or just email me your availability. If you prefer, you can meet me in the afternoon at my office. I am in the [Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods](https://qtm.emory.edu) almost every weekday. My office address is in the [Psychology and Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, 36 Eagle Row, 5th Floor, room XXXX](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bGHKwasQyp5MnQND6). If possible, please email me before coming to ensure that no two students book the same time slot.

# Academic Integrity

Upon every individual who is a part of Emory University falls the responsibility for maintaining in the life of Emory a standard of unimpeachable honour in all academic work. The [Honour Code of Emory College](http://catalog.college.emory.edu/academic/policies-regulations/honor-code.html) is based on the fundamental assumption that every loyal person of the University not only will conduct his or her own life according to the dictates of the highest honor, but will also refuse to tolerate in others action which would sully the good name of the institution. Academic misconduct is an offense generally defined as any action or inaction which is offensive to the integrity and honesty of the members of the academic community. Any suspected case of academic misconduct will be referred to the Emory Honour Council.

# Artificial Intelligence

Students have to submit ten problem sets and complete five in-class quizzes. You are allowed to use AI to assist with your assignments. I recommend using [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to generate code snippets, as it is free for students and provides good suggestions and explanations. [Claude](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), and [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai) are also good tools. I am available to provide support and assistance with these tools during office hours or by appointment. However, please note that any errors or omissions resulting from the use of AI tools are your responsibility. Do not rely solely on AI to complete your assignments; you must always double-check your work. Remember to cite all sources used in your problem sets and projects, including AI tools. Please include a note at the end of any document indicating that AI was used in its development.

# Special Needs and Accessibility Services

I am committed to providing necessary accommodations to ensure all students have an equal opportunity to succeed in this course. Students with medical or health conditions that may impact their academic performance should visit the [Department of Accessibility Services (DAS)](http://accessibility.emory.edu/) to determine eligibility for appropriate accommodations. Those who receive accommodations should provide me with an Accommodation Letter from DAS at the beginning of the semester or as soon as the accommodation is granted. Please note that DAS accommodations, such as extra time or quiet spaces, will apply only to quizzes, not assignments. This is because assignments are released in advance, allowing students to work at their own pace. Athletes and students with other commitments should also inform me of any scheduling conflicts at the beginning of the semester. I will do my best to accommodate these students, but I cannot guarantee that all requests will be granted. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

# English Language Learners

Emory University welcomes students from around the country and the world, and the unique perspectives international and multilingual students bring enrich the campus community. To empower multilingual learners, an array of support is available including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. For more information about English Language Learning support at Emory, please contact the ELLP Specialists at <https://writingcenter.emory.edu>. No student will be penalised for their command of the English language.

# Assignments and Grading Policy

**Problem Sets (50%).** There will be ten problem sets throughout the course. These assignments are designed to reinforce concepts covered in lectures and readings, and to provide hands-on practice with statistical programming. Problem sets will include a mix of theoretical questions and practical applications. They will be assigned regularly and must be completed individually. You may discuss your work with other colleagues as long as you do not copy entire sentences, just changing a few words. If you worked with other students, please write down their names on your assignment. Please also acknowledge any sources you used in your work, including textbooks, articles, and AI resources. *Any assignment submitted after the due date/time will automatically be graded for half points*. To accommodate unexpected circumstances, your lowest assignment grade will be automatically dropped at the end of the semester. *The same applies to in-class quizzes*. Please submit all assignments in Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`) via Canvas until midnight on the due date.

**Class Quizzes (30%).** Students will also take five in-class quizzes throughout the semester. These quizzes will be based on the lectures from the previous weeks. They will be designed to test your understanding of the material and your ability to apply the concepts to new problems. Quizzes will be open-book and open-notes, and students have 50 minutes to complete them. You are **not** allowed to use AI tools. They are individual assessments, and students are not allowed to discuss the questions with their colleagues in class. 

**Final Project (20%).** The final project will consist of a short report, created using Jupyter and using one of the datasets shared on the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/tree/main/final-project). Further instructions will be provided in class. The final project will be due on the last day of class.

# Grading Scale

Each student's final grade will be based on the following after rounding up to the nearest point:

| Grade | A       | A-      | B+      | B       | B-      | C       | D       | F    |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|
| Range | 91%–100%| 86%–90% | 81%–85% | 76%–80% | 71%–75% | 66%–70% | 60%–65% | <60% |

# Course Outline and Suggested Readings
