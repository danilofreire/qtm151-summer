# QTM 151 - Introduction to Statistical Computing II

Welcome to [QTM 151 - Introduction to Statistical Computing II](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer)! This repository contains all the materials for the summer course, including lectures, assignments, quizzes, and tutorials.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to statistical computing techniques using Python and SQL. It builds upon the foundational knowledge from QTM150 and focuses on practical applications of data analysis, reproducible research, and database management.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised as follows:

- [`assignments/`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/tree/main/assigments): Contains all course assignments
- [`lectures/`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/tree/main/lectures): Includes lecture materials and code
- [`tutorials/`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/tree/main/tutorials): Step-by-step guides for the tools used in the course
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/blob/main/README.md): This file, providing an overview of the course and repository
- [`syllabus.pdf`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/blob/main/syllabus.pdf): Course syllabus in PDF format

Each lecture folder contains an HTML file and a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with code examples and explanations, along with any additional resources or datasets used in the lecture.

### Assignments and Quizzes

Throughout the course, students will complete some assignments to reinforce their learning. These will be posted in the [`assignments/`](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer/tree/main/assigments) folder as the course progresses. We will also announce these in class and on Canvas. Please refer to the syllabus for due dates and submission guidelines.
