    "- Pivot tables in SQLite\n",

    "- As with many languages, you can merge two tables in SQL either **by columns or by rows**\n",
    "- The most common method is the `JOIN` clause\n",
    "- `JOIN` is used to **combine rows and columns from two or more tables** based on a related column between them\n",
    "- As you know, there are two types of keys, **primary and foreign keys**\n",
    "- The **primary key** is a column that **uniquely identifies each row in a table**\n",

    "  - One table can have **multiple foreign keys, and they can be `NULL`**\n",
    "  - SQLite supports foreign keys, and the Python `sqlite3` module handles them correctly by default\n",
