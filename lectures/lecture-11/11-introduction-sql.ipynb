    "\n",
    "- SQLite is a serverless database, which means it does not require a server to run\n",
    "- It is **a single file** that you can use to store your data\n",
    "- This has several advantages, such as:\n",
    "  - Easy to install and use\n",
    "  - Lightweight and fast\n",
    "  - Perfect for small projects\n",
    "- SQLite has some cons too, such as: \n",
    "  - Not being easy to scale \n",
    "  - Not allowing multiple users to write the database at the same time (although [some workarounds exist](https://fly.io/docs/litefs))\n",
    "  - Poor handling of time-series data. So far, [TimescaleDB for Postgres](https://www.timescale.com/) is the best option for this\n",
    "  - But SQLite also has [lots of extensions](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) to help you with many tasks (more on that later)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some people argue that SQLite is not a real database because it does not have a server, or that storing the database in a single file is not suitable for large projects\n",
    "- **Both arguments are false**:\n",
    "  - You can use [LiteFS](https://fly.io/docs/litefs) to scale SQLite and allow multiple users to write the database at the same time\n",
    "  - SQLite is capable of handling [databases that are an Exabyte in size](https://sqlite.org/hctree/doc/hctree/doc/hctree/index.html) (that's one million Terabytes, or one billion Gigabytes 🤯)\n",
    "  - I'm sure that this is more than enough for pretty much any project you will ever work on 😅\n",
    "- And to be honest, the difference between different SQL databases is not that big\n",

    "  - `TEXT`: Stores string values of any length using UTF-8 encoding\n",
    "  - `INTEGER`: Holds whole numbers (positive or negative)\n",
    "  - `NUMERIC`: Stores decimal numbers as floating-point values (SQLite often uses REAL for this)\n",
    "  - `BLOB`: Contains binary data preserved as input\n",
    "  - `NULL`: Represents missing or undefined data\n",
    "- SQLite also has **other data types** (often affinities to the core types), such as `REAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `TIME`, and `DATETIME`\n",

    "### Primary and foreign keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is used to uniquely identify each row in a table\n",
    "- It cannot contain `NULL` values and are usually integers\n",
    "- If you don't want to enter the numbers manually, you can use the `AUTOINCREMENT` keyword (though SQLite usually auto-increments integer primary keys by default if not specified otherwise, `AUTOINCREMENT` has specific behavior for ensuring ROWIDs are never reused).\n",
    "  - Example: `driver_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`\n",
    "- The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is used to link two tables together\n",
    "  - It is a field in one table that refers to the `PRIMARY KEY` in another table\n",
    "- We can also use `ROWID` to uniquely identify each row in a table, **but it is not recommended** for general use as a primary means of relating data.\n",
    "  - It is a hidden column that is automatically created, but deleting and reinserting a row can change the ROWID (unless `WITHOUT ROWID` is specified for the table), and relying on it directly is less portable to other SQL databases."
