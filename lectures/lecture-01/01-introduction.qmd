## My teaching philosophy
### What you can expect from me

<br>

- I love teaching and aim to make learning fun! üòÑ 
- Classes where students participate are the best
- Hands-on activities help you learn better
- I am always available to help and answer questions. [And I mean it!]{.alert}
- Feel free to ask questions during class, office hours, or via email `r emo::ji('smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes')`

## Office hours: What for and what not for

<br>

- What office hours are meant for:
  - Applying tools in practice
  - Discussion of issues related to the assignments
  - Boosting your knowledge of data science

. . . 

- What these sessions are [not]{.alert} meant for: 
    - Solving the assignments for you
    - Taking care of developing your coding skills

## Class etiquette

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}
- Coding can be tough and push you out of your comfort zone. If the course pace is too fast, let us know. I expect your commitment, but [I do not want anyone to fail]{.alert}
- You are all keen on data science, but your backgrounds vary. That is great! Some sessions might be more engaging than others. If you are bored, [help others]{.alert} or explore new data science areas
- [Always be respectful]{.alert} to each other
- [Ask questions]{.alert} whenever you need to!

# Course Logistics üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Course Objectives

1. Perform basic operations and write functions in Python
2. Conduct data wrangling and manipulate data using Python libraries such as Pandas
3. Merge and manage databases using SQL
4. Create visualisations to effectively communicate data insights
5. Implement linear models and understand the principles of time series analysis
6. Use Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible research
7. Develop problem-solving skills relevant to data analysis and statistical computing

## Grades and Late Policy

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
::: {style="font-size: 28px;"}
- Assignments (x10): [50%]{.alert}‚Äã
  - Practice class concepts‚Äã

- Quizzes (x4): [50%]{.alert}‚Äã
  - Questions are based on the lecture notes and assignments
  - Quizzes are open-book and open-notes (including the internet)

:::
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
::: {style="font-size: 28px;"}
- All materials will be available on the course website‚Äã and GitHub‚Äã repository
- Late assignments will automatically be graded for half-credit‚Äã
- To account for unforeseen circumstances, we will drop the worst assignment and the worst quiz‚Äã
- Watch out for the assignments to install software. You will need these to be able to use the lectures notes

# Computing Set Up üñ•Ô∏è {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Our Class in a Nutshell

![](figures/nutshell.png)

## Installing Python using Anaconda
### Anaconda has (almost) all the libraries we need

<br>

- Follow the instructions [on our GitHub website](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm151-summer/tutorials/01-vscode-anaconda-tutorial.html) 
- We are using Anaconda virtual environments for this class (I will cover this in more detail soon)‚Äã
- For now: Anaconda comes with a full Python installation‚Äã with everything you need to follow along with the course 

::: {.incremental}
- [Questions?]{.alert}
:::

## Installing VSCode and Connecting Anaconda‚Äã

:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 50px;"}
- Follow the instructions [Installing Visual Studio Code and Connecting it with Anaconda](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/blob/main/tutorials/01-vscode-anaconda-tutorial.pdf) from GitHub
- For now: know that "base" is the Anaconda virtual environment that comes by default with the installation‚Äã
- The next step is to check if the connection between VSCode and Anaconda worked 
  - In VSCode, click on "View" and then "Command Palette"
  - Type ["Python: Select Interpreter"]{.alert} and select the Anaconda environment you just created
  - I recommend using the ["base"]{.alert} environment for this course
- Next step: we will create a new folder for the QTM151 course and download our virtual GitHub folder and opening it in VSCode

# Git and GitHub üêô{background-color="#2d4563"}

## Git and GitHub

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others
- Imagine something like Google Docs plus Microsoft Word track changes, but for code (and much more powerful!)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration
- GitHub is a great way to share your code with others and collaborate on projects
- GitHub is also a social network for developers. You can follow other developers, star their projects, and contribute to open-source projects
- Create a free student account on GitHub here: <https://github.com/education/students>

# Jupyter Notebooks üìò {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Jupyter Notebooks

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a great way to combine code, text, and visualisations!
- If you have used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), you will find Jupyter Notebooks very similar
- They are widely used in data science and machine learning, and are a great way to share your work with others
- Please install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) for VSCode
:::

:::{.column width=60%}
:::{style="margin-top: -30px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/jupyter.png)

- If you are using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks should be installed by default. If not, you can install it using the Anaconda Navigator or the command line

```{verbatim}
conda install jupyter
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- We will use Jupyter Notebooks a lot for our classes!
- Quizzes and assignments will be in this format
- Our website has [a tutorial on how to use them too](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm151-summer/tutorials/02-jupyter-markdown-tutorial.html)
- There are both Jupyter Notebooks and lecture notes for each class in the course repository
- So you can choose which one you prefer to use, or use both!
- Lecture notes are designed to be followed along, and there will be many "try it yourself" exercises throughout the lectures!
:::

:::{.column width=60%}
- In case you have any trouble with the installation, you can also use an online version of Jupyter Notebooks included in our website: <https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm151-summer/>
- Just click on ["Jupyter Lite"]{.alert} and it will open a Jupyter Notebook in your browser

## Next Class

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"}
- Let me know if you have any questions about the course or the material or how to set up your computer
- We will start with the basics of Jupyter Notebooks
- We will also cover the basics of Anaconda and VSCode
- Please remember to check the course repository and the website at <https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-summer>  and <https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm151-summer>
- And please do not forget:
  - Coding ability can be developed
  - Academic skills and abilities are acquired through hard work, mistakes, and perseverance. Coding is no different
  - My only goal here is that you learn the material. Please ask me questions! `{r} emo::ji('smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes')`
