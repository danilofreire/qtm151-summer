# Introduction

This tutorial will guide students new to computer programming through the process of installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and connecting it with Anaconda. We will cover each step in detail to ensure a smooth setup process. If you have any questions or encounter issues during the installation, please feel free to ask for help from me (<danilo.freire@emory.edu>) or the QTM151 teaching assistants.

# Why VS Code?

VS Code is a popular, free code editor developed by Microsoft. According to the [2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment), VS Code is the most preferred integrated development environment (IDE) among developers. Here are some reasons to choose VS Code for Python development:

- Extensive Features and Extensions: VS Code offers several built-in features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and debugging. It also features hundreds of extensions that can increase its functionality, such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/).

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: VS Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so you can use it regardless of your operating system.

- Active Community and Support: The active community around VS Code means continuous updates and many  community-driven extensions now and in the future.

- Integration with Git and Other Tools: VS Code seamlessly integrates with version control systems like Git (as [Microsoft owns GitHub](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/)), making it easier to manage your code repositories and collaborate with others.

With that said, let us start the installation process.

    \label{fig:anaconda-verify}
\end{figure}

# Connecting VS Code with Anaconda

Now that both VS Code and Anaconda are installed, we will connect them to use Anaconda's Python distribution within VS Code. If they are connected correctly, you should be able to see the Conda and Python versions again in the VS Code output window.

## Install the Python and Jupyer Extensions in VS Code:

- Open VS Code and click on the Extensions view icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares). Search for "Python" in the search bar.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-python-extension.png}
    \caption{Python Extension in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-python-extension}
\end{figure}

- Find the [official Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) by Microsoft and click "Install".

- Please also install the [Jupyter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to work with Jupyter notebooks.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-jupyter-extension.png}
    \caption{Jupyter Extension in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-jupyter-extension}
\end{figure}

## Select the Anaconda Python Interpreter:

- Create a Python file in VS Code. Click on the "New File" button in the top left corner and save it with a `.py` extension. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-new-file.png}
    \caption{New Python File in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-new-file}
\end{figure}

- Include the following code in the file:

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| output: false
import sys
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)
```

- Save the file again. Here I saved it as `testing-anaconda.py`.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-save-file.png}
    \caption{Save Python File in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-save-file}
\end{figure}

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-command-palette.png}
    \caption{Command Palette in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-command-palette}
\end{figure}

- Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select it from the list.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-select-interpreter.png}
    \caption{Select Python Interpreter}
    \label{fig:vscode-select-interpreter}
\end{figure}

- Choose the Anaconda Python interpreter from the list. It should be labelled something like "Python 3.x.x ('base') Conda".

## Verify the Connection:

- Please click on the "Run" button at the top right corner of the editor to execute the code in your `.py` file. Select "Run Current File in Dedicated Terminal"

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-run-file.png}
    \caption{Run Python File in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-run-file}
\end{figure}

- The output should show the Anaconda Python version and its location.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/vscode-output.png}
    \caption{Python Output in VS Code}
    \label{fig:vscode-output}
\end{figure}

# Optional: GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and with fewer errors. It is available as an extension for VS Code. Detailed instructions are available on the [03-github-copilot-tutorial](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/blob/main/tutorials/03-github-tutorial.pdf) tutorial in the course repository, but I will provide a brief overview here. Please also refer to <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started-chat> for further instructions.

To install GitHub Copilot, follow these steps:

- First, sign up for a free educational license at <https://github.com/education/students>. This will give you access to GitHub Copilot and other GitHub features.

- On the website, click on "Join GitHub Education" and follow the instructions to verify your student status. You will need to provide proof of enrollment, such as a school email address or a document from your institution. The educational license is valid for two years.

- Once you have verified your student status, you can install GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Go to the Extensions view in VS Code (the square icon on the left sidebar) and search for [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot). Click on "Install". VS Code will install two extensions, GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat.

- After installing the extensions, you will need to sign in to your GitHub account in VS Code. Click on the GitHub icon in the left sidebar and follow the prompts to sign in.

- Once you have signed in, you can start using GitHub Copilot. It will provide code suggestions as you type, based on the context of your code. You can accept the suggestions by pressing `Tab` or `Enter`. You can also use the Chat tab (the speech bubble icon) to ask questions in natural language, like you do with ChatGPT or other chatbots, and Copilot will provide code snippets in response.

GitHub Copilot can be very helpful for writing code and answering questions, but it also makes mistakes. It is important to review the code suggestions and ensure they are correct before using them in your projects.
